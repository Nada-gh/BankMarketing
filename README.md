Using Data Mining for Bank Direct Marketing:
- The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed.
- Performed a comprehensive data analysis taking the messy raw data as input and turning them to informative insights about our data.
- Compared different techniques of dimensionality reduction (e.g., Univariate Selection, Recursive Feature Elimination, Principle Component Analysis, etc).
- Compared the accuracy of different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, ANN, etc).
